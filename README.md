# imitation Learning

This code is for training an agent to play the CarRacing-v2 environment from the Gym library using deep reinforcement learning techniques. It covers the following key aspects:

1. Setting up the environment and preprocessing the observations.
2. Defining a neural network policy for the agent to map states to actions.
3. Implementing behavioral cloning to train the policy network using expert demonstrations.
4. Evaluating the trained agent's performance in the environment.
5. Implementing the DAgger (Dataset Aggregation) algorithm to iteratively improve the policy by querying an expert policy and retraining on the aggregated dataset.
6. Exporting the final trained model in the ONNX format for submission or deployment.

The code provides utility functions for logging, plotting metrics, recording videos, and other helper methods. It also includes instructions and placeholders for the student to implement various components, such as the training loop, loss functions, and the DAgger algorithm.
